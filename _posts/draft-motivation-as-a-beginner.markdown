# Motivation as a beginner

Piano teacher quote:

> Separate the different voices and layers in the piece, and select the one that best defines the structure. Then learn these layers separately. As you learn each layer, starting by the structural one, study it and play it as if doing this were the ultimate goal, as if the composer had intended to only include the part of the piece you're playing.
