From a timeline perspective:

    Miro initially includes only screenshots of very low-fi wireframes drawn either by hand or with a very simple tool.
    These wireframes are the focus of discussion during meetings between tech, product and design. We improve upon these many times and we drop them if necessary. We should be able to produce an array of solutions to a problem in wireframes.
    We settle for one of the wireframes, and then specify exhaustively what the user can do in that view, and how it transforms due to these actions.
    We don't work with hi-fi designs until the cycle has started and we know how we're going to build a feature. Once these hi-fi designs are ready, they can be linked to from Miro, or their screenshots can substitute the wireframes.
    Translations are finished together with the hi-fi designs, and as part of them.


From a perspective of purpose:

    Wireframes are tools on which to iterate on a solution from the UX perspective. A wireframe can be very vague if it's meant to explain a general idea, or very detailed if it's the one we've chosen to implement. Before implementation, it ideally exhausts all possible things a user can do in a view. This means it could turn into many wireframes. Wireframes should be accompanied by text that explains them.
    Hi-fi designs are born from an exhaustive wireframe that's been accepted to be worked on during a cycle. It is almost a frozen specification of a snapshot of the UI we're trying to implement, and it doesn't need to be exhaustive in functionality. We can only change minor UI features like colors (if they're not central to the design), 


Reasoning (highly opinionated):

    Hi-fi designs, when used as tools for iteration, can make it hard to think about UX. There's a lot of colors, a lot of decisions behind each element, and those are UI decisions. Setting them aside and only having black lines can help discuss the low-level UX issues and come up with new solutions.
    Wireframes do not give a sense of rigidity. If I get a wireframe, I'll feel free to make suggestions about it. This may not be the case with a hi-fi design.
    It's easy to tell whether a wireframe is very detailed or if it's a vague sketch to showcase an idea. This is not the case (and not a possibility) with a hi-fi design.
    No tools are strictly necessary to build a wireframe. I can use pen and paper and show my wireframe to others. Or, if I know how to, I can use Balsamiq or some of the other fancy stuff out there.
